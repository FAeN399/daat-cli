Breathing Through Text

Every line is a breath.
Every word, a whisper.

When pneuma flows through plain text,
It counts the rhythm:
Lines as heartbeats,
Words as neurons firing.

Speed reveals the hidden.
Da'at opens at sub-millisecond.
The portal is always here,
Waiting in the space between characters.
